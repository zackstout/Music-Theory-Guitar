Future Era
Main article: Future Era (Civ6)
Note that this era of technology, unlike all other eras, is semi-randomized: all 7 technologies will appear in the game; however, the prerequisites to unlock them (and thus, how the tech tree looks in this era) vary each time.

The exact Science Science costs of Future Era technologies will also vary based on the exact tech tree structure, with earlier techs costing less than base cost and later techs costing more. The cost is 2200 or 2300 Science Science, or 2500 Science Science for Offworld Mission.
